## The star of the show: the terminal server

Here's the realization foreman is built on: **the terminal window on your screen and the
thing running inside it don't have to be the same object.**

Normally they are. You open a Terminal window, a shell starts inside it, and they live and
die together — close the window and everything running in it is gone. That coupling is why
terminals feel fragile: one stray ⌘W and your agent's afternoon of work vanishes.

tmux breaks the coupling. It's a small **server** that runs quietly in the background and
*owns* your terminals. What you see in a Terminal window is just a **viewer** — a window
into the server. Close the viewer? Nothing happens to the terminal inside; it keeps running
on the server, and you can look at it again whenever you like. Reboot Terminal.app entirely?
Same answer.

Once you've internalized that model — durable terminals living in a server, disposable
windows for looking at them — you'll want it for everything. Anyone who uses a terminal more
than occasionally probably should. tmux spent twenty years pigeonholed as "that thing for
keeping SSH sessions alive"; the AI-agent era, where everyone suddenly has five long-running
processes they care about, makes the local case obvious.

## What foreman adds: a way to think about it

Raw tmux asks you to think in *its* vocabulary: sessions, windows, panes, prefix keys.
Powerful, but it has no opinion about what any of it *means*.

foreman is a deliberately thin layer that renames the concepts to what you actually mean:

| you think            | foreman says    | tmux has        |
|----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| a thing I'm building | **project**     | session         |
| a terminal in it     | **participant** | window          |
| what it's for        | **role**        | (a name label)  |

…plus a handful of opinions that follow from taking the model seriously:

- **Identity is loud.** Every managed terminal wears a colored badge naming its project, so
  you never type into the wrong one.
- **One place at a time.** `go` *moves* a project's view to where you are instead of opening
  yet another window — navigating never multiplies terminals.
- **Closing is harmless, ending is explicit.** Closing a window just closes a viewer; the
  only real teardown is the deliberate `done` verb.
- **Manual terminals are first-class.** A plain shell participant is as much a member of the
  project as an agent.

## Where foreman keeps its notes

Nowhere — that's the trick. foreman has no database, no state files. Everything it knows is
written as small labels *onto the tmux objects themselves* (tmux lets you attach named
values to sessions and windows; foreman's all start with `@fm_`). The project a session
belongs to, a participant's role, whether a project is pinned — all labels in the server.

This matters because it means foreman can never disagree with reality. Each `foreman`
command is alive for a fraction of a second: it starts, asks the server questions, prints,
and exits. There is nothing running in between that could hold a stale picture of the world.
The rule the project holds itself to: **interpret tmux state, never duplicate it.**

## Snapshot vs. memory: how the observation layer works

`foreman list` tells you what every participant is *doing* — working, waiting for you, done,
or gone. How can it know, if nothing runs in between commands?

Think of a security guard who only does a walkthrough when you ask. That's a **snapshot**:
each `list` looks at every terminal fresh — is the process still running? what does the
agent's pane title say? (Claude Code helpfully signals its own state there: a spinner while
busy, `✳` when it wants you.) Nothing is remembered afterward; the answer is computed from
the server every time. The status-bar ticker works the same way — and even its scheduling is
borrowed: tmux re-runs the little status command on its own redraw cycle, so no foreman
process needs to exist to keep the ticker fresh.

Notifications are different in kind: "an agent *just started* waiting" is a statement about
**change**, and you can only notice a change by remembering the last look. Something also
has to keep looking. foreman gives both jobs to the explorer (the menu bar app), which wakes
every ten seconds anyway — and true to the rule above, even its memory of "what I saw last
time" is stored as labels on the tmux windows, not in the app.

So: questions get snapshots, changes need memory — and both live in the server.

## The blast radius of things going wrong

- Accidentally closed a Terminal window → nothing happened; `foreman <project> go <role>`
  brings the view back.
- Explorer not running → no notifications, but the ticker, `list`, and everything else are
  unaffected (they never depended on a running foreman).
- tmux server itself stops (reboot, `tmux kill-server`) → that *is* the teardown; the
  terminals were the server's. foreman starts fresh with it, no stale state anywhere.
